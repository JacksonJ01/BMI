    This program makes use of information of the internet to calculate the BMI of a user.
    In general this calculation can be a bit unreliable. Two people can have the same BMI,
     let's say 26, which is considered overweight. One person may actually be overweight,
      while the other may be more muscular. Naturally muscle weighs more than fat,
       so the body type of the user must be considered.

    Information for the general calculation
    - Height
    - Weight

    Optional Questions
    - Age(the BMI is catered towards adults because the have stopped growing for the most part)
    - Gender(this doesn't really make a big difference)
    - Waist
      - Men               <=40
      - Women             <=35

    BMI Scaling
    - Underweight         <18.5
    - Normal Weight        18.5 - 24.9
    - Overweight           25 - 29.9    (Increased Risk)
    - Obese                30 - 34.9    (High Risk)
    - Very Obese           35 - 39.9    (Very High Risk)
    - Extremely Obese     >40           (Extremely High Risk)
